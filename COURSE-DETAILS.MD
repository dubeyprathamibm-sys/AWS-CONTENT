## 💡 Some Additional Notes / Tips

* Since only 50 of the 65 questions are scored, **you won’t know which ones are unscored**, so try to answer all sincerely. 
* Manage your time well: 90 minutes for 65 questions → ~1.3 mins/question on average.
* Use the process of elimination: for multiple-choice, eliminate wrong options first.
* Because there is **no negative marking**, it’s smarter to guess than to leave a question blank.
* After the exam, you'll get a **scaled score**. Even if you feel you got a lot right, the scaling system means not every question is “equal” in weight. ([Cert Empire][7])
